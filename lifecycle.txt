    Initialization: This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class.
    Mounting: Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself.
    Updating: Updating is the stage when the state of a component is updated and the application is repainted.
    Unmounting: As the name suggests Unmounting is the final step of the component lifecycle where the component is removed from the page.

   
    you can take advantage of the useEffect hook to achieve the same results as with the componentDidMount, 
    componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount methods. useEffect accepts two parameters. 
    The first one is a callback which runs after render, much like in componentDidMount.
    The second parameter is the effect dependency array. If you want to run it on mount and unmount only, pass an empty array [].
